# Random Background Color Generator with localStorage

This is a small learning project I created to practice using **localStorage** in JavaScript. 

When you click the button, it generates a random background color for the page and saves that color in the browser's local storage. The color persists even after refreshing or reopening the page until a new color is generated.
